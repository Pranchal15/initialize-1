            Initialize is a five-week-long peer learning event that focuses on competitive
            programming, data structures, and algorithms. Over five weeks, you
            will be learning DSA and CP concepts right from the basics and also
            be competing with your peers in weekly contests.
            <br />
            <br />
            The
            coding.Studio(); team will be personally mentoring the participants
            throughout the the event. Learning sessions will take place right
            here at the c.S(); HQ, accompanied by practice sessions and contests
            on Discord. The event will conclude in a final show of skill, a
            Grand Contest, and y'all winners just get bragging rights. Nah, we
            have something special for ya ;)
            <br />
            <br />
            The objective of Initialize is to create a culture of consistent
            competitive programming practice and also to encourage our peers who
            want to kick-start their competitive programming journey.
